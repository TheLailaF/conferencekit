# What's in this toolkit 

All of these links can always be found in the menu to the left. (Individual pages' submenus will appear to the upper right for each page.)

    <summary><b>Why does this website exist? Who made it?</b></summary>
    <br>
    See our [introduction](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter00_preface/introduction.html), our [mission](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter00_preface/mission.html), and our [community guidelines](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter00_preface/guidelines.html).
    <br><br>
    Here are some [examples of personas in different circumstances](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter00_preface/audience.html) together with suggestions for how they might use this toolkit.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>How should we form the planning committee? What should we think about well before the event?</b></summary>
    <br>
    See our [introduction](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/introduction.html), some [reflections upon equity and communication](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/reflections.html) and [understanding discipline-specific EDI priorities](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/disciplines.html), and an example [planning committee Code of Conduct](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/committee_conduct.html).
    <br><br>
    We also have ideas for how EDI factors into planning regarding [funding](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/funding.html), [marketing](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/marketing.html), and the [event website](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter01_planning/website.html).
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>What should we keep in mind before the event regarding logistics?</b></summary>
    <br>
    We have an [introduction and checklist](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/introduction.html), and a section on the various aspects of the [event program](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/program.html) itself.
    <br><br>
    Items to consider include [event dates](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/dates.html), [event venue](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/venue.html), [registration procedures](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/registration.html), and [training for event staff](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter02_pre/training.html).
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>What should we keep in mind during the event itself?</b></summary>
    <br>
    Again we have an [introduction and checklist](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter03_conference/introduction.html).
    <br><br>
    We have thoughts on [fostering inclusive participation](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter03_conference/inclusive_participation.html), [different types of event sessions](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter03_conference/inclusive_participation.html), and [equitable awards](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter03_conference/awards.html).
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>How can we evaluate our event's EDI? How can we preserve and build upon lessons for future events?</b></summary>
    <br>
    Here are an [introduction and checklist](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/introduction.html), and [ways to describe the impact of EDI efforts](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/impact.html).
    <br><br>
    We have thoughts concerning [surveys of participants](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/surveys.html), [debriefing within the planning committee](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/debrief.html), and [building connections](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/chapter04_post/building_connections.html).
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Are there some tools and templates we can use, to not reinvent the wheel?</b></summary>
    <br>
    Here are some sample [templates](https://firasm.github.io/conferencekit/content/templates/templates.html) for registration forms, budget spreadsheets, and evaluation frameworks, and a sample [multi-page report](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-multipage-report/) for qualitative and quantitative data about event EDI. We also have some widgets to record and store that information and to share it with others.
