# Introduction 

As you begin to imagine the inclusive conference or learning gathering you hope to plan, it's important to consider how diversity will be represented on the planning committee. Consider the following when establishing your planning team:
- Will members of your planning committee represent diversity of identity, gender, experiences, and expertise?
- What local Indigenous protocols need to be observed, respected, and enacted upon?
- Will the planning committee benefit from seeking the expertise of a local Indigenous Knowledge Keeper, and staff and/or faculty working in the area of diversity and inclusion?
- Will the planning committee “hold space” to invite other experts into the planning as needed?

In bringing together a collaborative, equitable planning committee you might also consider the following:
- Be mindful that in striving for diversity and inclusion equity-deserving groups are often asked to take on the labour of educating others about diversity. Consider how you might alleviate that burden and/or compensate people for their contributions. 
- Educate and recognize diversity and inclusion barriers in the field
- Establish shared understandings, values, objectives with recognition that shared and common understandings very often reflect the presumptions and expectations of already privileged positions. 
- Hold space for those who raise critical questions of the field (such as whose knowledge and perspectives are established as common sense).
- Recognize and reflect on potential implicit biases in the planning itself.
- Establish principles that you will use to help structure the planning. 
- Add clarification
