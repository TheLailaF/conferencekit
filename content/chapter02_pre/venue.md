## Choosing a Venue

When choosing a venue, consider the space and possible uses and barriers from as many angles as possible. In particular, you might use your analysis of the gaps and barriers in your own field (such as unconscious bias) to address who might have been excluded from participation in the past? This will most likely include racialized, Indigenous, gender diverse, and physically and invisibly disabled people as well as people who are parenting, graduate students and contract faculty on limited budgets. 

- What accessibility protocols, processes, procedures, structures are already in place?
- Can the venue provide spaces for rest and reflection, family gatherings, informal connection?
- Can child care be supported either within or close to the venue?
- Will the venue allow for a barrier free flow between the events on the program schedule: or would people need to navigate inaccessible building structures, transportation, etc.?
- What kind of technical supports are provided by the venue?
