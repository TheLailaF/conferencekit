# General Principles & Introduction
## For the Design of Inclusive Conferences and Learning Gatherings
### Who We Are
Under the direction of the Senior Advisor to the Provost on Women and Gender-Diverse Faculty, a committee representing a cross-section of faculty, staff, and graduate students from University of British Columbia, Okanagan campus (UBCO), and University of British Columbia, Vancouver campus (UBCV) has been assembled (names are listed below). We bring a diversity of backgrounds, identities, and experiences. We are committed to the work of creating the structures necessary to ensure that conferences (including panels and lecture series) and other types of learning gatherings held on campus or organized by UBC community members, are equitable, diverse, strength based, and inclusive. As knowledge itself (knowledge production and sharing) is at the core of the University’s purpose, our goal is to create a community agreement with specific goals and actions for inclusive conference planning and design. 
### Commitments
The University of British Columbia is an institution of learning in two interconnected and interdependent ways. First, we are a community in which people from all parts of the world, and from many different backgrounds, come to live and learn together at UBC on the traditional, ancestral and unceded lands of the Musqueam people, Vancouver campus, and the Syilx people of the Okanagan Nation, Kelowna campus [1](https://native-land.ca). Second, we are also dedicated to continuous and active institutional learning exchange about systemic inequality and the insidious, sometimes intangible, dynamics of privilege and oppression. We aspire to be an open, expansive, and expanding learning community.

The University of British Columbia is committed to recognizing and honouring the historical and ongoing contributions of equity-deserving groups who have been historically, persistently, or systemically marginalized at the intersections of race, religion, gender, sexuality, class, and disability. As a first step on the long, collective path towards intersectional social justice, we declare solidarity with equity-deserving groups and communities. 

### Who are equity-deserving groups?
Equity-deserving groups can vary among disciplines, and often include BIPOC (Black people, Indigenous people (First Nations, Metis and Inuit), and people of colour), LGBTQIA2S+ people (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and/or Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Two-Spirit people, and any other ways in which individuals affirm their identites), women and gender-diverse people, and people with visible and invisible disabilities3. Going further, we unequivocally dedicate ourselves to structural and systemic transformations of academic research, curricula, and pedagogy that value and practice equity, diversity, and inclusion.

### Mission
Our ultimate goal is to build and sustain institutional capacity for welcoming and retaining researchers, educators, community members, and students from equity-deserving groups. As well, our mission is to center such people in positions of leadership and partnerships from which they have been (and, too often, continue to be) excluded.

We recognize this process requires us to begin with the foundations of institutional structures across and within disciplines and units. The core of our mission is to ensure that learning events (i.e., conferences, seminars, congresses, symposiums, etc.), associated with UBC, are designed to foster a diversity of knowledges, identities, and experiences that contribute to all fields and conversations. We commit to do the following:

- Establish specific actions for reconciliation, including decolonizing educational methodologies and practices and holding space for Indigenous perspectives and knowledges from Indigenous peoples;
- Identify and remove barriers for equity-deserving groups and individuals
- Identify leaders and partners, and create a forum for equity-deserving groups to contribute their lived experiences [2](https://www.sinsinvalid.org/news-1/2020/6/8/access-suggestions-for-public-events)
- Create and provide resources for conference organizers to recognize and centre the diverse lived experiences, needs, and aspirations of participants
- Create and provide resources for conference organizers on issues related to diversity, and the benefits for inclusion across the institution, and within disciplines
- Design conferences that are inclusive, including an environment in which all participants:
    - have the freedom to learn and share knowledge and experiences
    - have access to spaces, supports, and tools needed for that freedom
    - understand their responsibility to one another as well as the conference and university’s standards of inclusion, equity, and diversity
- Conduct research (quantitative and qualitative) that measures and analyzes the impacts of the community agreement and makes recommendations

As part of this process, we are asking for community feedback on what you think is needed to create inclusive and diverse conferences, panels, and speakers at UBC. We hope you participate and partner with us on this journey to advance inclusion and equitable access at UBC.
