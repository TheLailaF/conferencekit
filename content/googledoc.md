# General Principles & Introduction
## For the Design of Inclusive Conferences and Learning Gatherings
### Who We Are
Under the direction of the Senior Advisor to the Provost on Women and Gender-Diverse Faculty, a committee representing a cross-section of faculty, staff, and graduate students from University of British Columbia, Okanagan campus (UBCO), and University of British Columbia, Vancouver campus (UBCV) has been assembled (names are listed below). We bring a diversity of backgrounds, identities, and experiences. We are committed to the work of creating the structures necessary to ensure that conferences (including panels and lecture series) and other types of learning gatherings held on campus or organized by UBC community members, are equitable, diverse, strength based, and inclusive. As knowledge itself (knowledge production and sharing) is at the core of the University’s purpose, our goal is to create a community agreement with specific goals and actions for inclusive conference planning and design. 
### Commitments
The University of British Columbia is an institution of learning in two interconnected and interdependent ways. First, we are a community in which people from all parts of the world, and from many different backgrounds, come to live and learn together at UBC on the traditional, ancestral and unceded lands of the Musqueam people, Vancouver campus, and the Syilx people of the Okanagan Nation, Kelowna campus [1](https://native-land.ca). Second, we are also dedicated to continuous and active institutional learning exchange about systemic inequality and the insidious, sometimes intangible, dynamics of privilege and oppression. We aspire to be an open, expansive, and expanding learning community.

The University of British Columbia is committed to recognizing and honouring the historical and ongoing contributions of equity-deserving groups who have been historically, persistently, or systemically marginalized at the intersections of race, religion, gender, sexuality, class, and disability. As a first step on the long, collective path towards intersectional social justice, we declare solidarity with equity-deserving groups and communities. 

### Who are equity-deserving groups?
Equity-deserving groups can vary among disciplines, and often include BIPOC (Black people, Indigenous people (First Nations, Metis and Inuit), and people of colour), LGBTQIA2S+ people (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and/or Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Two-Spirit people, and any other ways in which individuals affirm their identites), women and gender-diverse people, and people with visible and invisible disabilities. Going further, we unequivocally dedicate ourselves to structural and systemic transformations of academic research, curricula, and pedagogy that value and practice equity, diversity, and inclusion.

### Mission
Our ultimate goal is to build and sustain institutional capacity for welcoming and retaining researchers, educators, community members, and students from equity-deserving groups. As well, our mission is to center such people in positions of leadership and partnerships from which they have been (and, too often, continue to be) excluded.

We recognize this process requires us to begin with the foundations of institutional structures across and within disciplines and units. The core of our mission is to ensure that learning events (i.e., conferences, seminars, congresses, symposiums, etc.), associated with UBC, are designed to foster a diversity of knowledges, identities, and experiences that contribute to all fields and conversations. We commit to do the following:

- Establish specific actions for reconciliation, including decolonizing educational methodologies and practices and holding space for Indigenous perspectives and knowledges from Indigenous peoples;
- Identify and remove barriers for equity-deserving groups and individuals
- Identify leaders and partners, and create a forum for equity-deserving groups to contribute their lived experiences [2](https://www.sinsinvalid.org/news-1/2020/6/8/access-suggestions-for-public-events)
- Create and provide resources for conference organizers to recognize and centre the diverse lived experiences, needs, and aspirations of participants
- Create and provide resources for conference organizers on issues related to diversity, and the benefits for inclusion across the institution, and within disciplines
- Design conferences that are inclusive, including an environment in which all participants:
    - have the freedom to learn and share knowledge and experiences
    - have access to spaces, supports, and tools needed for that freedom
    - understand their responsibility to one another as well as the conference and university’s standards of inclusion, equity, and diversity
- Conduct research (quantitative and qualitative) that measures and analyzes the impacts of the community agreement and makes recommendations

As part of this process, we are asking for community feedback on what you think is needed to create inclusive and diverse conferences, panels, and speakers at UBC. We hope you participate and partner with us on this journey to advance inclusion and equitable access at UBC.

## Community Guidelines
### Introduction
Glen Coulthard, member of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation and associate professor in the First Nations and Indigenous Studies Program and the Departments of Political Science here at UBC writes, “Place is a way of knowing, experiencing, and relating with the world” (“Place Against Empire” 80). Place, says Coulthard, is the reference point for Indigenous Knowledge and meaning. It is in place that all autonomous beings are interconnected in an ongoing process of obligation and reciprocity, humans’ obligations to other people as well as the environment, the animals, plants, water and land, and the environment’s reciprocal obligations to humans. It is with this understanding of place and reciprocity that we co-developed the following Community Agreement for Inclusivity for designers of learning events, conferences, seminars, congresses, etc. The guidelines within this Agreement are a reflection of the already diverse and interconnected community of scholars, staff, and students at UBC. They have been designed in recognition that there are people and groups that encounter structural barriers to their full participation in the making and sharing of knowledge that is at the foundations of the university community. We have not designed the guidelines in order to pass judgement or prescribe a set of boxes that must be checked in order to meet a set of standards. Instead, these guidelines are pathways to cultivating relationships and fostering a community in which all peoples and contributions are valued and honoured. The work that the guidelines reflect is open-ended and recursive. It is an ongoing process and there is no expectation that everyone will find all situations completely accessible at all times. Developing the guidelines themselves included the contributions of people and groups that might not already be centered in the current planning of conferences and other events and learning gatherings. We encourage each department/learning community at UBC to make these guidelines their own.

### Who are these Guidelines for?
This living document offers a set of initial guidelines intended for members of the university community who work collaboratively to organize inclusive learning events. From establishing the planning committee tasked with navigating conference logistics including selection of venue and speakers, scheduling of sessions, and organizing networking and social opportunities, to asking all participants to contribute towards promoting collective access, the recommendations in what follow are intended for all involved in the design of learning events.

> “This guide is a springboard to re-imagining learning events where each organizer and participant sees themselves in a reciprocal, inclusive, and accessible place of learning.”

#### “Learner” Personas (User personas?)
Here is one for inspiration.

[**Anya Academic**](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/10/learner-personas/#anya-academic)

1. Anya, a professor of neuropsychology, studies color perception in infants. She is also responsible for teaching an introduction to statistics to 1100 first-year students every year. (Students complain that the Stats department’s introductory course is too theoretical and requires more programming knowledge than they have.)
2. Anya runs several experiments on 50–100 infant subjects each year. She used to analyze the results with SPSS, but is switching to R (which she taught herself during a sabbatical). She has never taken a programming course, and suffers from impostor syndrome in discussions about things like GitHub and R Markdown.
3. Anya would like to learn more about time series analysis to support her research, and about tools like Git and R Markdown. She also wants guidance using R to teach her intro stats course, which currently uses a mixture of Excel and SPSS.
4. Anya is juggling half a dozen responsibilities at work, and doesn’t want to look uninformed in front of her colleagues and students.

Anya needs workshops (so that she can allocate focused time) and how-to guides (for her research). She would like ready-to-use lesson material she could remix for her students and some orientation material to demystify jargon (what the hell is a “pull request”?). Finally, it’s important that she be able to use the same tools in her research as in her teaching in order to amortize learning costs and stay in practice.

# Pre-Event Logistics
## General Principles
These general principles are guided by intersectional approaches to access and inclusion practiced by organizations led by disabled Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) including Sins Invalid, Krip Hop Nation, and Autistic Self Advocacy Network. Among the transformative practices of these organizations is a commitment to access as collective, shared labor that recognizes the importance of “centering the leadership of those most affected.”[3](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bed3674f8370ad8c02efd9a/t/5f1f0783916d8a179c46126d/1595869064521/10_Principles_of_DJ-2ndEd.pdf)

-  How do conferences, symposia, and other public-facing events further the university’s commitment to learning as articulated at the outset of this document?
- Why might references to diversity and inclusion be regarded as problematic within communities that face ongoing systemic discrimination? 
- What is the original context of the term “intersectionality” and how do we ensure that our own work honors the history of this term?
- Universal Design for Learning (UDL) has been widely adopted as a generative framework in recent years. UDL developed out of universal design principles in architecture and seeks to create learning situations in which “all learners can access and participate in meaningful, challenging learning opportunities” (CAST). Yet researchers, educators, and communities continue to urge caution, noting that the promise of “universality” in these frameworks is potentially a barrier to structural transformation, equity, and justice. How might our own engagement with Universal Design carefully navigate and honor these critiques by drawing on the practices of Disability Justice?

## Getting Started
As you begin to imagine the inclusive conference or learning gathering you hope to plan, it's important to consider how diversity will be represented on the planning committee. Consider the following when establishing your planning team:
- Will members of your planning committee represent diversity of identity, gender, experiences, and expertise?
- What local Indigenous protocols need to be observed, respected, and enacted upon?
- Will the planning committee benefit from seeking the expertise of a local Indigenous Knowledge Keeper, and staff and/or faculty working in the area of diversity and inclusion?
- Will the planning committee “hold space” to invite other experts into the planning as needed?

In bringing together a collaborative, equitable planning committee you might also consider the following:
- Be mindful that in striving for diversity and inclusion equity-deserving groups are often asked to take on the labour of educating others about diversity. Consider how you might alleviate that burden and/or compensate people for their contributions. 
- Educate and recognize diversity and inclusion barriers in the field
- Establish shared understandings, values, objectives with recognition that shared and common understandings very often reflect the presumptions and expectations of already privileged positions. 
- Hold space for those who raise critical questions of the field (such as whose knowledge and perspectives are established as common sense).
- Recognize and reflect on potential implicit biases in the planning itself.
- Establish principles that you will use to help structure the planning. 

## Introductory Reflection
As the planning committee works together to make decisions about the venue, dates and times, and other event logistics, it is important to keep the purpose of the event at the forefront (I.e. sharing of diverse knowledges, collaboration, and relationship building). Focus your approach on valuing diversity and fostering the full, barrier-free participation of all contributors and attendees. As noted in the introduction, not everyone can be accommodated at all times. This is a process. Committing to create a professional learning environment that is welcoming and supportive on a practical/logistical level is integral to the foundations of an inclusive and equitable event that benefits everyone. 

### Pre-Conference Communication
Fostering inclusive participation starts with the initial messaging to potential participants. As organizers, how will you reach out to equity-deserving groups in ways that possible registrants recognize your commitment to inclusivity, accessibility, and equity? From initial announcements of when the registration will open to your early descriptions of the conference/learning gathering, it is critical that your messaging reflects your commitment to designing an accessible conference/learning gathering where diversity of identity is valued, expected, and respected, and where diversity of knowledges, scholarly research, and beliefs and perspectives is integral to fulsome participant engagement and deepening the learning experience.
