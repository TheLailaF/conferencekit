# Venue

### Choosing a Venue

When choosing a venue, consider the space and possible uses and barriers from as many angles as possible. In particular, you might use your analysis of the gaps and barriers in your own field (such as unconscious bias) to address who might have been excluded from participation in the past? This will most likely include racialized, Indigenous, gender diverse, and physically and invisibly disabled people as well as people who are parenting, graduate students and contract faculty on limited budgets. 

- What accessibility protocols, processes, procedures, structures are already in place?
- Can the venue provide spaces for rest and reflection, family gatherings, informal connection?
- Can child care be supported either within or close to the venue?
- Will the venue allow for a barrier free flow between the events on the program schedule: or would people need to navigate inaccessible building structures, transportation, etc.?
- What kind of technical supports are provided by the venue?

## Programme Development and Speaker Selection

> We are working to build a community in which human rights are respected, and equity and inclusion are embedded in all areas of academic, work and campus life. (UBC Equity & Inclusion Office)

The selection of speakers and presenters and the organization of the program for conferences and other learning events often contribute to the social dynamics of power that act as a barrier to a diversity of expertises, knowledges, and contributions to the university and individual disciplines. We often have implicit biases that require us to take a step back and to look at established cultures and processes from different perspectives. Are all members of the planning committee invited to offer their perspectives and experiences on how the process might be more equitable and inclusive? The following suggestions are intended to support the planning committee in addressing these often hidden barriers within and cross academic institutional structures that might impede the academic community from achieving its fullest potential.

## Valuing diversity for all sessions

## Establishing inclusive and equitable processes for paper and presentation selections

- Inviting other evidence of expertise and experience--CVs can perpetuate professional “gate-keeping”
