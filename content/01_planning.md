# Community Guidelines

## Introduction

Glen Coulthard, member of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation and associate professor in the First Nations and Indigenous Studies Program and the Departments of Political Science here at UBC writes, “Place is a way of knowing, experiencing, and relating with the world” (“Place Against Empire” 80). Place, says Coulthard, is the reference point for Indigenous Knowledge and meaning. It is in place that all autonomous beings are interconnected in an ongoing process of obligation and reciprocity, humans’ obligations to other people as well as the environment, the animals, plants, water and land, and the environment’s reciprocal obligations to humans. It is with this understanding of place and reciprocity that we co-developed the following Community Agreement for Inclusivity for designers of learning events, conferences, seminars, congresses, etc. The guidelines within this Agreement are a reflection of the already diverse and interconnected community of scholars, staff, and students at UBC. They have been designed in recognition that there are people and groups that encounter structural barriers to their full participation in the making and sharing of knowledge that is at the foundations of the university community. We have not designed the guidelines in order to pass judgement or prescribe a set of boxes that must be checked in order to meet a set of standards. Instead, these guidelines are pathways to cultivating relationships and fostering a community in which all peoples and contributions are valued and honoured. The work that the guidelines reflect is open-ended and recursive. It is an ongoing process and there is no expectation that everyone will find all situations completely accessible at all times. Developing the guidelines themselves included the contributions of people and groups that might not already be centered in the current planning of conferences and other events and learning gatherings. We encourage each department/learning community at UBC to make these guidelines their own.

## Who are these Guidelines for?

This living document offers a set of initial guidelines intended for members of the university community who work collaboratively to organize inclusive learning events. From establishing the planning committee tasked with navigating conference logistics including selection of venue and speakers, scheduling of sessions, and organizing networking and social opportunities, to asking all participants to contribute towards promoting collective access, the recommendations in what follow are intended for all involved in the design of learning events.

"This guide is a springboard to re-imagining learning events where each organizer and participant sees themselves in a reciprocal, inclusive, and accessible place of learning."
